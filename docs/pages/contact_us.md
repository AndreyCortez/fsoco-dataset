> **Note**
> <br>
> Currently, we do not have enough raw images to assign labeling jobs to teams without own data.
> If your team does not have in-house images, we recommend you to contact more experienced teams and convince them to sponsor images to the FSOCO community.
> Teams that sponsor other teams will benefit from a reduced number of required annotations.
> The exact reduction depends on the number of sponsored images and will be decided case-by-case; minimum 50% if they can sponsor at least one other team. 
> If you team up with another team, please note that both teams have to submit the form below and fill in the other team as a partner.
